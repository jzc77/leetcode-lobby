# LeetCode Lobby

## About
This repo contains a collection of my Leetcode solutions in **Python**

## My approach
I am working my way through all the Neetcode problems (https://neetcode.io/practice).

I provide my thought process before starting my solution. This is a way for me to organize my thoughts.

I also provide my first attempt (usually brute force). Then I will either think up a way to solve it more efficiently or I would partially watch the corresponding solution video for a hint.

At first, I created unit tests for my solutions to practice unit testing and to provide edge cases. However, I switched to using doctests instead.

## Random things learned
File names can't start with numbers for unit testing in Python
